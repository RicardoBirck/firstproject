<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
<p> My name is Ricardo Birck, and I love philosophy and technology!</p>

<p>My background is in education and app development. From 2017 to 2022,
   I was the co-founder of an ed-tech that built a language learning app called Lingua Franca. 
   My roles included setting the vision, developing the curriculum, designing features, creating 
   prototypes, and talking to users (rinse and repeat). I used my experience teaching English, 
   German, and Portuguese as foreign languages to develop the app's curriculum.</p>

<p>I currently work at Fit Body App as an Operations Manager. My role is very similar to the 
  above-mentioned tasks (with the exception of the curriculum development). I also oversee all 
  operations within the company, which include day-to-day operations with the app development team,
  the creative and marketing team, as well as manage third-party partnerships.</p>

<p>Since 2022, I've also been teaching Philosophy, primarily Objectivism, to private students 
  (in English), via the Ayn Rand Center Latin America (in Spanish), and via Objetivismo Brasil 
  (in Portuguese).</p>

  <p>I'm currently learning to code, starting with Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My intention 
    is to more effectively implement app features and enhance my communication with the development team.</p>
